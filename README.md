This is a sample NODE.JS, EXPRESS project, using FIREBASE to implement connection with NEST API, MongoDB to save user data, 
MailGun to send out notification emails, BACKBONE and REQUIREJS as front end frameworks.

It shows the magic of immediate update of information in either Nest API or client API upon any changes in 
either of these applications.

Please, watch DemoVideo and DemoVideo_Part-2.
